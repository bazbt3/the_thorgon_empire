# The Thorgon Empire

## Rules:

## Rule 1: a universe that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Star Trek.

---

## Races:

## Humans
* *Terran* Human status: obsolete
* Humans are a social race, intent on expansion beyond any reasonable ability to sustain an environment.
* Unpredictability is the key to becoming a successful Human. The often-used term 'Thinking outside the box' is all very well until the emergency escape pod malfunctions. The term 'disruptive' became very popular before the Trunk Wars, a time later historians classified as 'quite' disruptive.

### Brobarn (Captain)
* Inferior captain, but thinks he's the best (legend in his own mind)
* Hates Captain Hadron

### Hadron, Tim (Captain)
* Timmy Hadron's father
* Hates Captain Brobarn
* Likes to recount tales of exploration to his son.
* Needs order, the insignia of rank counts for a lot.
* Has the normal human urge to ignore orders, as Captain has the authority to frequently implement the philosophy.

### Hadron, Timmy
* Timothy Hadron II
* Captain Hadron's son
* Failed introductory space examination after The Broken Toilet Incident, the day he learned the difference between weight and mass.
* Clumsy, impatient(?)
* Overweight due to a mistaken belief thus a neglect of his this-far-successful diet regime, that the new ship would have an always-on weightless environment.
* Nickname, acquired after a spectacularly unsuccessful attempt to navigate a temporary zero-gravity environment; resulting in bruises, inadvertently-activated controls and a total loss of face amongst his peers: '[The Large Hadron Collider](http://youtu.be/qQNpucos9wc)'.
* Savours the scant time with his father, loves the tales he recounts, has a down-to-earth and often insightful approach to philosophical issues.

## Thorgons
* Thorgon race status: static.
* Most of the attributes listed are contained within **The Thorgon Creed**, a complex set of instructions explicitly designed to channel every aspect of a Thorgon's existence towards conformance.
* Thorgons are a race devoid of the positive attributes of sociability, creativity, imagination. Within a very narrow frame of reference the Thorgons define their 'happiness' (if that term is appropriate) by an entirely different set of attributes to the Human. The ideal Thorgon possesses an innate sense of order, a resistance to change, and especially champions the suppression of innovation and independent thought.
* They progress up the administrative foodchain by subordinating other races and technologies. Their belief in their own superiority helps.
* Utterly ruthless where the potential for easy profit is missing.
* Straight lines and acute angles are missing in Thorgon design.
* Whilst the term 'bureaucratic machine' normally refers to a concept of layers of frustration, the Thorgons have a bureaucratic machine. Just the one. It's huge.

### Ag-AckAck Snurf
* Known as Snurf only to itself and Humans
* Under-Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist, a title earned during decades serving the Empire's bureaucratic machine.
* One side-effect of his long association with the Humans: dark, subversive, questioning thoughts barely quashed, all growing with time.

## Other races:

## Unknown
### V!lurm (Commander)
* Has only one negative report on her permanent record: that  of allowing the Thorgon fleet through the wormhole. As biggies go, it's a biggie.
### Franck (Commander)
* Also known informally as Number One by Captain Hadron.
* Designated raiding party leader, only once having that specific part of the chain of command overriden by his Captain. It didn't end well.

---

## Planets:

### Earth
* A once classically Earth-like planet, laid waste during the Trunk Wars.
* Clearance completed.
* Final-stage mining underway.

### Planet 9
* A vaguely Earth-like planet, jointly selected for Human colonisation by a Human-Thorgon committee.
* Terraformed.
* Vogon-capable-formed.
* Do not confuse with the higher-capacity Solar System 9.

### Thorgon Prime
* Where to beginâ€¦

---

## Ships:

## Human
### Technology
* Starlight Drive. Capable of faster-than-light travel.
### Challenger
### Discovery
### Endeavor
(Picked US Space Shuttles that weren't named "Enterprise" -- see rule 1)

## Thorgon
### Technology
* The Thorgons possess a faster-than-light drive so are *capable* of faster-than-light travel. Insanely (by Human standards) inefficient when required in a hurry, The Very Fast Drive needs *huge* quantities of fuel and a strategic approach to activation. Used sparingly; the Thorgon has patience.
* Everything else is a closely-guarded secret even within the Thorgon hierarchy. It appears on-demand, instigated by those who know things. 
### Thorgon 9
* Mothership assigned to Planet 9.
* Has Very Fast Drive, though slow to achieve terminal velocity.
* Named after a senior Thorgon administrator.
* Do not confuse with the higher-capacity Planet 9.
### Thorgon 9c
* Thorgon 9 shuttle c.
* No factory-fitted faster than light drive capability.
* Interplanetary range.
* Do not confuse with the higher-capacity Ark C.
### Ark C
* One of a fleet built by the Vogons in Earth orbit before the planet became suboptimal for resource extraction.
* Designed for Human resettlement.
* Designed and constructed in accordance with Thorgon Budget Approvals Subcommittee Rules, but due to an administrative oversight never passed up to the Thorgon Budget Approvals Subcommittee Rules Oversight Subcommittee for budget approval.
* 'C' is the only known viable Ark ship due to the failures caused by insufficient budget deployment caused A and B to fail and crash into those inconveniently-placed suns.
* Slow, ponderous, quite large.
* Multiple failures approaching Planet 9, mainly due to the lack of maintenance of both the life support and emergency escape pods.

## Meta:

### Caveats:
1. 'Pretty close to [canonical](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Canon)' is a definition. It can be bent, twisted, tossed aside, ignored entirely as the situation demands.
1. Aren't we lucky to have such a breadth of [documentary evidence,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) from which extracted interpretations can enhance *this* documentation?
