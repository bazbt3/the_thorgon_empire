# The Thorgon Empire

## Thorgons
* Thorgons are a race devoid of the positive attributes of sociability, creativity, imagination; but Thorgons define themselves by: an innate sense of order, a resistance to change, and especially champion the suppression of innovation and independent thought.
* They progress by subordinating other races and technologies, using their belief in their own superiority.
* Thorgon race status: static

### Ag-AckAck Snurf
* Known as Snurf only to itself and Humans
* Under-Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist (a title earned during decades serving the Empire's bureaucratic machine)
* One side-effect of his long association with the Humans: dark, subversive, questioning thoughts bareley quashed and growing with time.
