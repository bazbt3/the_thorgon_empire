# The Thorgon Empire

## Rules:

## Rule 1: a universe that is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Star Trek.

---

## Races:

## Humans
* *Terran* Human status: obsolete
* Humans are a social race, intent on expansion beyond any reasonable ability to sustain an environment.
* Unpredictability is the key to becoming a successful Human. The often-used term 'Thinking outside the box' is all very well until the emergency escape pod malfunctions. The term 'disruptive' became very popular before the Trunk Wars, a time later historians classified as 'quite' disruptive.

### Brobarn (Captain)
* Inferior captain, but thinks he's the best (legend in his own mind)
* Hates Captain Hadron

### Hadron (Captain)
* Timmy Hadron's father
* Hates Captain Brobarn

### Hadron, Timmy
* Captain Hadron's son
* Failed introductory space examination
* Clumsy, impatient(?)
* Overwweight

## Thorgons
* Thorgon race status: static.
* Thorgons are a race devoid of the positive attributes of sociability, creativity, imagination. Within a very narrow frame of reference the Thorgons define their 'happiness' (if that term is appropriate) by an entirely different set of attributes to the Human. The ideal Thorgon possesses an innate sense of order, a resistance to change, and especially champions the suppression of innovation and independent thought.
* They progress up the administrative foodchain by subordinating other races and technologies. Their belief in their own superiority helps.
* Whilst the term 'bureaucratic machine' normally refers to a concept of layers of frustration, the Thorgons have a bureaucratic machine. Just the one. It's huge.

### Ag-AckAck Snurf
* Known as Snurf only to itself and Humans
* Under-Deputy-Vice-Sub-Snarglist, a title earned during decades serving the Empire's bureaucratic machine.
* One side-effect of his long association with the Humans: dark, subversive, questioning thoughts barely quashed, all growing with time.

## Planets:

### Earth
* A once classically Earth-like planet, laid waste during the Trunk Wars.
* Clearance completed.
* Final-stage mining underway.

### Planet 9
* A vaguely Earth-like planet, jointly selected for Human colonisation by a Human-Thorgon committee.
* Terraformed.
* Vogon-capable-formed.
* Do not confuse with the higher-capacity Solar System 9.

### Thorgon
* Where to beginâ€¦

---

## Ships:

## Human
### Technology
* Starlight Drive. Capable of faster-than-light travel.
### Challenger
### Discovery
### Endeavor
(Picked US Space Shuttles that weren't named "Enterprise" -- see rule 1)

## Thorgon
### Technology
* The Thorgons possess a faster-than-light drive so are *capable* of faster-than-light travel. Insanely (by Human standards) inefficient when required in a hurry, The Very Fast Drive needs *huge* quantities of fuel and a strategic approach to activation. Used sparingly; the Thorgon has patience.
* Everything else is a closely-guarded secret even within the Thorgon hierarchy. It appears on-demand, instigated by those who know things. 
### Thorgon 9
* Mothership assigned to Planet 9.
* Has Very Fast Drive, though slow to achieve terminal velocity.
* Named after a senior Thorgon administrator.
* Do not confuse with the higher-capacity Planet 9.
### Thorgon 9c
* Thorgon 9 shuttle c.
* No factory-fitted faster than light drive capability.
* Interplanetary range.
* Do not confuse with the higher-capacity Ark C.
### Ark C
* One of a fleet built by the Vogons in Earth orbit before the planet became suboptimal for resource extraction.
* Designed for Human resettlement.
* Designed and constructed in accordance with Thorgon Budget Approvals Subcommittee Rules, but due to an administrative oversight never passed up to the Thorgon Budget Approvals Subcommittee Rules Oversight Subcommittee for budget approval.
* 'C' is the only known viable Ark ship due to the failures caused by insufficient budget deployment caused A and B to fail and crash into those inconveniently-placed suns.
* Slow, ponderous, quite large.
* Multiple failures approaching Planet 9

## Meta:

### Caveats:
1. 'Pretty close to [canonical](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Canon)' is a definition. It can be bent, twisted, tossed aside, ignored entirely as the situation demands.
1. Aren't we lucky to have such a breadth of [documentary evidence,](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction) from which extracted interpretations can enhance *this* documentation?
