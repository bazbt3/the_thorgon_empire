## A sub-novelette outline

I am not a writer, this will become obvious to any discriminating reader.

The 2 file formats (I gave up on RTF) are saved here purely for ease of access across platforms but with some styling because I'm intending to add more pictures!

* **PDF** is everywhere and needs no introduction.
* **ePub** is a cross-platform e-book file format. 

Now, because GitHub treats 'binary' files differently to regular sites, opening both may not be easy.  In this case ask me for an alternative (Dropbox?). Heck though, it may not even be worth it!
