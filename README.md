## The Thorgon Empire

An outline of a small part of a future universe [**(see the Outline document here)**](Outline.md) originally created during the App.net [\#WednesdayChallenge](https://github.com/bazbt3/appdotnet_stuff/wiki/WednesdayChallenge) - a weekly 256-character story writing challenge.

Warning: documents within may contain worryingly-'imaginative' extrapolations from the original.

See the [**\#WedC**](https://pnut.io/tags/WedC) hashtag *(pnut.io)* for live updates on a number of themes.

Initially inspired by @mlv's imagination on App.net and a Q2 2017 [pnut.io post](https://posts.pnut.io/72575) by @schmidt_fu.

"This universe is intended to be almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Star Trek." --@mlv
