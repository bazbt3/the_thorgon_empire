## The Thorgon Empire

> "This universe is intended to be almost, but not quite, entirely unlike Star Trek."    
--@mlv

An outline of a small part of a future universe [**(see the not-quite-a-wiki document here)**](Outline.md) originally created during the App.net [\#WednesdayChallenge](https://github.com/bazbt3/appdotnet_stuff/wiki/WednesdayChallenge) - a weekly 256-character story writing challenge.

Warning: documents within may contain worryingly-'imaginative' [extrapolations from the original.](https://github.com/bazbt3/the_thorgon_empire/tree/master/words)

See the [**\#WedC**](https://pnut.io/tags/WedC) hashtag *(pnut.io)* for live updates on this and a number of other themes.

**Credits, acknowledgments:**

Initially inspired by @mlv's imagination on App.net and a Q2 2017 [pnut.io post](https://posts.pnut.io/72575) by @schmidt_fu.
